Load the transaction_data.csv dataset. Check the table size, variable types, number of missing values and descriptive statistics.

What values are in the transaction column? How many observations belong to one level or another? Visualise the result with a barplot. Think about how the graph can be improved.

How many transactions ended in error?

How many successful transactions did each user perform? Construct a histogram of the distribution of the number of successful transactions.

A colleague has sent you updated data. (transaction_data_updated.csv)
Build a user_vs_minute_pivot crosstab, where the columns are user names, rows are minutes and values are the number of transactions performed in a given minute. Fill in the missing values with zeros.

Examine the graph presented. Help your colleague to find out if there is an error in the data, or if all is well.
If there is an error in the data, correct it and store the correct number of minutes since the beginning of the day in the true_minute column.
