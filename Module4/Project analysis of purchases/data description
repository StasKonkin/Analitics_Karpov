This time, the data has the following structure:
- recorded for each user who has made a purchase, each day
- each date has a folder and inside it there are folders for each user
- inside each folder there is a file data.csv, where the data is stored

It looks like this:

└── data
   ├── 2020-12-30
      │  ├── FirstName_LastName1
         │  │   └── data.csv
            │  ├── FirstName_LastName2
               │  │   └── data.csv
                  │  └── FirstName_LastName3
                     │      └── data.csv
                        └── 2020-12-31
                              ├── FirstName_LastName1
                                    │   └── data.csv
                                          └── FirstName_LastName5
                                                    └── data.csv

For example, on December 30 three customers made purchases, on December 31 two customers made purchases (folders 2020-12-30 and 2020-12-31 respectively). Because customer FirstName_LastName1 bought goods on both days, there is a folder for him in the folder for each of the dates. There is one folder for the other clients.
Note: the data in the job covers a different time period, the names are different too.
