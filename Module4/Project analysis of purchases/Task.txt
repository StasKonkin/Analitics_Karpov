Collect all the data from the data folder into one dataframe with the following columns: columns from the files themselves (product_id, quantity), as well as the user name (name), and the date of these purchases (date, corresponds to the name of the folder where the user's folder lies).

Find out which user has bought the most items. If there is more than one, list the names separated by a comma with a space and in alphabetical order.

Find the top 10 items by the number of units sold over all time and build a barplot. How many units of the product with product_id==56 were sold?

Visualise the sales by days.

How many users have purchased any product repeatedly (more than 1 time)? Repeat purchases of an item with the same product_id made on different days will be considered as repeat purchases.
